    <h2 id="chapter 1">Chapter 1: The last lesson</h2>
    <p>The narrator of the story is Franz – a student in the class of M. Hamel. One morning Franz was late for school. His teacher, M. Hamel, had told his class that he would be asking questions on participles on that day. Franz felt like bunking school for a moment. But he resisted the urge and went to school. On his way to school, he saw people clustered in front of the bulletin board, and, as usual, he assumed that there was some bad news. It had been happening since Prussia annexed their district of Alsace.

The day felt unusual compared to regular days, as there was no commotion in the classroom. Everything was quiet, and instead of being scolded by M. Hamel, Franz was asked to go to his seat quickly. He noticed something odd about his teacher. M. Hamel was not wearing his usual clothes – he wore extravagant clothes only meant for school inspection or prize days. Another odd thing that day about the school was that most of the villagers, including the former mayor, former postmaster, etc., were sitting on the back benches and looked sad.

As the class began, the teacher, M. Hamel, announced that this was his last French lesson for his students as the Prussians had announced that French would no longer be taught in schools. Franz felt a sudden pang of remorse. He realised what the bad news on the bulletin board was: French was no longer to be taught in schools. Franz felt sorry about bunking his classes and not bothering about his lessons. He realised the villagers had come there to pay their respects to M. Hamel’s forty years of service as a teacher. It was also about showing respect for their country, which was not theirs anymore.

When it was Franz’s turn to recite, M. Hamel was patient. He did not scold Franz. He went on to discuss their district’s problem – the assumption that they always had plenty of time. That is how the students lagged in their lessons – because they had taken their freedom and time for granted. Then M. Hamel blamed himself and Franz’s parents for making him do chores rather than letting him focus on his studies. M. Hamel went on to talk about the beauty of French – their mother tongue – and how everyone should hold on to it even if it were not taught at schools. He explained that when people are enslaved, the only key to redeeming their freedom is the common language that they share. He had brought new copies for the students and decorated the classroom for them.

Franz felt that everything his teacher was teaching was lucid and easy to understand. He blamed himself for not listening to the lessons properly. Franz discovered that M. Hamel was supposed to leave the country. He realised how difficult it must have been for his teacher to leave a place he had stayed and served in for forty years. As the clock struck twelve and the Prussians blew their trumpets, the class ended, and M. Hamel said goodbye to his class by writing ‘Vive La France’ on the blackboard since he was too emotional to speak. He leaned his head against the wall and made a gesture with his hand – implying that the school was dismissed.</p>

        <h2 id="chapter 2">Chapter 2: DEEP WATER</h2>
        <p>The story has been taken from the author’s autobiography- ‘Of Men and Mountains’.
In this piece, he tells about his fear of water and how he conquered it by determination and willpower.

As a child, when he was 3 or 4 years old, he would go to the beach in California with his father. He would get scared by the might of the huge waves which swept over him and it instilled fear in his subconscious mind.

A few years later, in his eagerness to learn swimming, he joined a swimming pool where an incident further increased his terror. He was pushed into the pool by another boy and experienced death closely.

Many years after that incident, he stayed away from water but the desire to go fishing and swimming in nature was strong enough to motivate him to overcome his fear.

He learned swimming with the help of an instructor who ensured that William knew swimming well enough to be able to swim in huge lakes and waterfalls also.
Still, when he would swim, the fear from his childhood experiences, embedded in his subconscious mind would grip him over and over again. He wanted to conquer that fear.</p>

        <h2 id="chapter 3">Chapter 3: MY MOTHER AT SIXTY SIX</h2>
        <p>This is a touching poem written by Indian poet Kamla Das who wrote under the pen name of ‘Madhavikutty’. In this poem, she describes her feeling of love and attachment towards her ageing mother.

Once the poet went to visit her mother. She was on her way back to the the airport to return to Cochin. She looked at her mother who was seated beside her in the car. Her mother had dozed off to sleep and her ageing face – was smoky in colour like ash. Her mouth was open and she resembled a dead body. The poet realized that her mother was old. She felt pain and sympathy for her. Her mother needed love, affection and care.

In order to come out of the gloom, the poet shifted her glance and looked out of the car’s window. There she saw young trees pass by. Little children were running out of their houses into the playgrounds. These things were contrary to the ageing face of her mother. They symbolised energy, life and happiness.As they reached the airport and the poet was about to leave for the aeroplane, she glanced at her mother one more time. Her mother appeared weak and pale just like the moon in the winter season which seems to have lost all its strength. The poet felt the pain and fear of losing her mother. She was reminded of her childhood when she used to fear losing her mother. As a child she could not bear to be separated from her mother even for a few moments. Now the loss would be permanent as her mother was about to die and she would lose her forever.

The poet did not express her feelings. She smiled and said “see you soon, Amma” because she wanted that her mother should live and they could meet again.</p>
